# Code-Challange

Hello, this is a coding challenge I did for KeyStoke! 
If you want to start the app on localhost, clone this repo and run `npm start` in the command line. 
The server should be running on port `3001`. 

If you want to see the deployed version of my project, take a look at https://blooming-cove-53651.herokuapp.com/
For more information on how I created this app, read below: 

## Getting Started
Knowing that I only had around six hours to complete this project, there was a lot I had to cut from 
my original starting process of developing applications.

I am a *very* visual person, and so much of the struggle was with figuring out a way to build a full stack 
app off an idea that was sparsely made out on solely a sheet of paper. 

On the other hand, there was a lot I had struggled with when building this application. I am normally a fan of using 
Redux, but under these time constraints I thought it would be a faster move if I did without using it this time. 
Unfortunately, I found out that not using Redux for this actually resulted in a lot of confusing passages of state 
and props between components, and I consider now that it probably would have been a better decision if I would have
taken the time in the beginning to set up Redux in the first place. 

## What I Learned
I learned that developing fast applications has more to do with using the *right tools* than anything else.
